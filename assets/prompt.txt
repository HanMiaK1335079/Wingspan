Prompt 1:
I will give you an image and I need you to convert the info on each card into this format: Acorn_Woodpecker f www 5 cavity 4 46 WA:gainfromfeederchoosecache:wAmerican_Avocet w iiw 6 ground 2 79 OBT:whenplayerlayseggslayegg:ground Where the first one is name (Anna's_Hummingbird, or Black-Bellied_Whstling-Duck), formatted with space split as underline but everything else kept same.second is habitat. If multiple habitats, put them in order of w->p->f, so a bird with wetlands and plains would be wp (blue is w, yellow is p, green is f). Third is food, just do it in order (i for insect, w for wheat, r for rat, f for fish, b for berry), fourth is feathers (the number next to the feather), fifth is nesting type (cavity (one in tree), bowl (bowl), platform (sticks with flat thing under), ground(hexagon tile thing), any (star)), next is maxEggs (just count the number of eggs in the corner), then it is wingspan (labbelled). Finally, the ability (WA->when activated, OBT->once between turns, WP -> when placed), then a quick descriptor. If the abilities are really similar or the same as another bird, then the quick descriptor should be the exact same. Ex: if burrowing owl has abilty WA:rolldicetocache:r and black skimmer has ability Roll all dice not in birdfeeder. If any are  , cache 1  from the supply on this bird., then the black skimmer ability note should be WA:rolldicetocache:f

prompt 2: 
if there is a specific type of food referenced then use the colon to indicate it. For example, the American Goldfinch should be American_Goldenfinch pf ww 3 bowl 2 23 WP:gain3food:w
